# AI-Dream-Bank

The project serves as an app that helps in journalling our dreams and interpreting the meaning of them, using several NLP functionalities such as symbolic representation, sentiment analysis for over 20,000 datasets (https://dreambank.net/) and then implements a deep learning model.

This model can further help in bringing out the hidden meaning that our sub-conscious mind tries to convey with dreams as a medium while we are in our sleep.

Furthermore, it helps in analysing the REM cycles and the quality of sleep gained. This can help in serving as a self-care and self-help application.

Usage of AWS DynamoDB, helps in saving the large database in NOSQL format.

Our aesthetic UI makes the app look beautiful.

**HOW IT WORKS:
**
It is a great practice to journal our dream as soon as we wake up, so that we do not forget them.
Our app lets the user to record their audio/type in their dream. This dream can be recorded and with the use of our trained model, we will be able to interpret the meaning hidden in the dream which can help the user to analyse the cause! This is a very ancient technique which is used by therapists and healers to understand the sub-consious emotions.

Having a track of REM and quality of sleep can help in better health too!
